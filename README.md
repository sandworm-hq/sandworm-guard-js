## TL;DR
- Sandworm intercepts all sensitive Node & browser APIs, like `child_process.exec` or `fetch`.
- It also knows what modules are responsible for each call.
- You can use it to:
  - audit your dependencies and see what your code is doing under the hood;
  - secure your app against supply chain attacks by enforcing per-module permissions.
- Install it as an `npm` module in your existing Node or browser app.
- Use the Inspector CLI tool to monitor activity and permissions.

### Getting Started

Add the Sandworm init call as the very first line of your app:

```js
require('sandworm').init({devMode: true, // add `permissions: [...]` when moving to prod});
```

Then launch the inspector tool with `npm run sandworm` or `yarn sandworm` to monitor activity and permissions.
