## TL;DR
* Sandworm Guard intercepts all potentially harmful Node & browser APIs, like arbitrary code execution (`child_process.exec`) or network calls (`fetch`). It knows what packages are responsible for each call.
* Simple obfuscation techniques can confuse static analysis tools, but Sandworm's dynamic analysis will always intercept risky calls at run time.
* You can use Sandworm Guard to:
  * [audit your dependencies](https://docs.sandworm.dev/#getting-started), monitor activity and permissions, and see what your code is doing under the hood using the Inspector;
  * [generate a security profile](https://docs.sandworm.dev/test-framework-plugins) automatically from your test suite and do snapshot testing against it;
  * [secure your app against supply chain attacks](https://docs.sandworm.dev/#enforcing-permissions) by enforcing per-module permissions.
* Install it as an `npm` module in your existing Node or browser app.
* Works in Node v15+ and [modern browsers](https://browsersl.ist/#q=defaults). Beta support for browsers and sourcemaps.

### Getting Started

Add the Sandworm init call as the very first line of your app:

```js
require('@sandworm/guard').init({devMode: true}); // add `permissions: [...]` to enforce
```

Then launch the inspector tool with `npm run sandworm` or `yarn sandworm` to monitor activity and permissions.
